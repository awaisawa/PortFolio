## Getting Started with Create React App

<!-- The following section is about setting up the React application locally. -->

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<!-- Link to Create React App repository. -->

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

<!-- This command starts the React app in development mode. -->
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
<!-- This is the URL where the app can be accessed locally. -->

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
<!-- Any issues or errors during development will be displayed in the browser console. -->

### `npm test`

<!-- This command runs the test suite for your project. -->
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
<!-- This link provides more details about testing your React app. -->

### `npm run build`

<!-- This command builds the app for production, optimizing the code. -->
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
<!-- After building, the app is optimized for better performance in production. -->

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
<!-- The minified code and hashed filenames help with caching and reducing the app's size. -->

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
<!-- Provides a link to the Create React App documentation for deployment steps. -->

### `npm run eject`

<!-- The `eject` command is for advanced users who want more control over the build configuration. -->
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
<!-- Ejecting will give you full control over configuration files like Webpack, Babel, etc. -->

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
<!-- This gives you full control of the projectâ€™s configuration, but comes at the cost of added complexity. -->

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
<!-- Ejecting is only necessary if you have specific customization needs that aren't met by Create React App's default setup. -->
